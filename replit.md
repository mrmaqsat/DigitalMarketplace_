- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy and session-based auth
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions using connect-pg-simple
- **File Uploads**: Multer for handling file uploads with local storage

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver

- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Dark/light theme support via CSS variables
- Toast notifications and loading states
- Modal dialogs and sidebars for enhanced UX

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via login form
2. Passport.js validates against database using scrypt password comparison
3. Session created and stored in PostgreSQL
4. User object cached in React Query for client-side access
5. Protected routes check authentication status before rendering

### Product Purchase Flow
1. User browses products and adds items to cart
2. Cart state managed through TanStack Query with API persistence
3. Checkout process creates order record with associated order items
4. Cart cleared upon successful order completion
5. Digital files made available for download in user dashboard

### Product Upload Flow
1. Seller accesses upload form with file selection
2. Images and files uploaded via Multer to local storage
3. Product metadata stored in database with "pending" status
4. Admin reviews and approves/rejects products
5. Approved products appear in public marketplace

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connectivity
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/***: Comprehensive UI component library
- **passport**: Authentication middleware
- **multer**: File upload handling
- **express-session**: Session management

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Build tool and development server
- **typescript**: Type checking and compilation
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **@hookform/resolvers**: Form validation integration
- **zod**: Runtime type validation

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- Frontend: Vite builds React application to static assets
- Backend: esbuild bundles Node.js server with external dependencies
- Assets: Uploaded files served statically from uploads directory
- Database: Drizzle migrations applied via `db:push` command

### Environment Requirements
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- **SESSION_SECRET**: Secure session signing key (required)
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment flag (development/production)

### Production Considerations
- Session store configured for PostgreSQL persistence
- File uploads limited to 50MB with organized directory structure
- Trust proxy settings enabled for proper client IP detection
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
